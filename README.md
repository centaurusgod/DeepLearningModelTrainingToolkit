Welcome to Deep Lerning Model Training Toolkit. Donot worry, even if you are a rookie I will provide you full guidance on how to setup, build your own image classification model, test the model and deploy the model as well. I won't be like most of the people who just dump their code on github and lead you to void. I assure you that you can build your own model. I will be very precise and make you aware of any errors that I faced so you will get insights on how to solve those errors on your own. 

## Important
- This guide will be helpful to those who want to train the model using nvidia gpu's or integrated gpu. I donot have any idea on setting up Radeon GPUs to train the model, so you need to figure out that on your own.
- Using dedicated gpu will make the training extremly fast as compared to integrated GPU so it is recommended to use a dedicated graphics card for training.
- If you just want to see how it works and you donn't mind using dedicated GPU then you can directly jump to Step 3
