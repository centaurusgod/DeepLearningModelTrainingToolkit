Welcome to Deep Lerning Model Training Toolkit. Donot worry, even if you are a rookie I will provide you full guidance on how to setup, build your own image classification model, test the model and deploy the model as well. I won't be like most of the people who just dump their code on github and lead you to void. I assure you that you can build your own model. I will be very precise and make you aware of any errors that I faced so you will get insights on how to solve those errors on your own.
